user to the homepage upon submission.
2. home: the page to which the user arrives after sign in; giving a welcome 
to the user.
3. catalog: displays the books and their relevant information.
4. about us: the backstory to the application and its design.
5. help: allows for submission of a help request to the site owners.

challenges with website display and interaction. The site works best on Google
Chrome and other browsers may face limited functionality.

## Developer Manual: ##
1. To install application and dependencies: 
    1. Download all files from github and open in Visual Studio Code within a folder. 
    2. Create an account on and generate a new API key from https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview.
    3. Fill in the quotes after const bookapi = "" in the files
    bookchart.js, index.js, and catalog.js with your API key.
    4. Setting Up Supabase:
        1. Create an account on https://supabase.com/, then navigate to https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects and create a new project. 
        2. Go to Table Editor and create a table called "Favorites", with columns: 'id' (int8), 'title' (text), 'created_at' (timestamptz), 'image (text), 'genre' (text), 'description' (text), 'author' (text), and 'link' (text). Additionally, deselect "Enable Row Level Security (RLS)"
        3. Within you project copy supabase url and API key from Settings > API and in index.js, add them inside the quotes of const supabaseUrl = '' and const supabaseKey = '' respectively.

2. To run the application on a server: enter npm start in Visual Studio Code, and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. To terminate the batch job, press Ctrl + C while in the VSCode terminal
and enter 'Y' for yes. From there, you can run npm start again.
3. Tests written for software: No tests
4. API and endpoints
    - Books API - https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview
    - Endpoint 1: randombooktitle
        - Generates a random book title from the catalog
        - This is done using GET endpoint
    - Endpoint 2: favorites
        - Using supabase, a book from the catalog is added to the "What Have Others Liked" box when the thumbs up image is clicked.
        - This is done using a GET and POST endpoint.
5. Expectations regarding bugs and future development
    - Add onto pages css and functionality.
    - Create a larger array of various categories, not limited to like different genres, book lengths
    - Sign-in page currently accepts any username and password combination, so future developers will need to implement account creation functionality.
    - Once account creation functionality is added, a “my books” page can be implemented so that users can add their personal favorites from the catalog.
    - The contact button currently is not implemented
    - Current Bugs Detected:
        - Hover element for book information in main catalog bar doesn't appear in Microsoft Edge.
        - Random book title generation is sometimes unreliable and varies between users.
        - Server crashes sporadically.
